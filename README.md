# Amazon Product Review Analytics Dashboard (Power BI)

## Overview
This project presents an interactive, multi-page Power BI dashboard developed to analyze Amazon product data across pricing, discounting, ratings, and review reliability. It is designed to support decision-making in product management, marketing strategy, and customer experience evaluation.
The report leverages calculated DAX measures, dynamic visual elements, and clean visual design to deliver insights into how pricing and promotional strategies impact customer satisfaction, while also identifying patterns of potentially unreliable product ratings.
